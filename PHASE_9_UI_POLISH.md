# ✅ Phase 9: UI/UX Overhaul (The "Weavy" Look) - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Goal
Transform the prototype into a polished product that mimics the "Weavy" aesthetic (Dark Mode, Dashboard, IDE feel).

---

## 🎨 Design System Updates

### 1. Dark Mode Transformation
- **Dashboard:** Created a new Landing Page (`/`) with a dark theme (`bg-black`).
- **Editor:** Converted the light canvas to a dark IDE style (`bg-neutral-950`).
- **Consistency:** Unified colors across Sidebar, Header, and Nodes.

### 2. Dashboard (Home Page)
- **Layout:** Implemented a "Workspace" layout with a Sidebar and Main Content area.
- **Workflow Library:** Added colorful template cards.
- **My Files:** Grid view of actual MongoDB-saved workflows.

### 3. Visual Polish
- **MiniMap:** Styled the React Flow MiniMap to blend with the dark theme.
- **Scrollbars:** Hidden native scrollbars.
- **Zoom Controls:** Styled React Flow controls to match the dark theme.
- **Nodes:** Updated Custom Nodes with dark backgrounds (`bg-neutral-900`).
